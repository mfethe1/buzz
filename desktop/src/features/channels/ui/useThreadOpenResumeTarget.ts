/**
 * One-shot "resume where I left off" target, latched per thread open.
 *
 * The decision is captured **during render**, not in an effect: the panel's
 * own layout effect bottom-pins on its first commit, so a target seeded from
 * an effect always lands too late. This mirrors `openFrontierRef` in
 * `useChannelUnreadState`, which writes during render for the same reason.
 *
 * A captured `null` is latched too. That is a decision ("nothing was unread
 * when this opened"), and it is what stops a live reply arriving into a
 * fully-read thread from re-deriving a target and jumping the reader.
 *
 * The latch must not fire while replies are still arriving. A thread reopened
 * from cache renders one reply off the channel timeline first, and at that
 * point the unread marker has not been recomputed — so the latch would capture
 * `null`, which this hook keeps as a deliberate decision. The real target
 * arrives with the rest of the replies and is then ignored forever, leaving
 * the reader bottom-pinned: exactly what this resume exists to replace. That is
 * why `hasReplies` is expected to fold in the caller's settled-query gate, and
 * why `hasReadHistory` rides that same gate rather than one of its own.
 *
 * `fetchStatus` is the caller's signal there, not `isPending`. A refetch over
 * cached data reports `isPending: false` while still in flight, so pending
 * alone lets the early render through. `"idle"` means nothing is on the wire —
 * true once the replies have landed, and true for a forum thread whose query is
 * disabled and whose replies resolve from the channel timeline instead. Paired
 * with a reply-count check, a query that has not started yet is excluded as
 * well, since it has no replies to latch onto.
 *
 * `hasReadHistory` has to arrive already frozen, from the same open-time
 * snapshot the unread divider reads (`threadOpenReadSnapshotRef` in
 * `useChannelUnreadState`). Deriving it here instead — snapshotting the panel's
 * visible replies on this hook's own first sight of them — loses the race
 * against the on-open mark-read effect and reports read history for a thread
 * the reader has never opened, which resumes them to the top: the exact defect
 * the guard exists to prevent. It was measured, not theorised.
