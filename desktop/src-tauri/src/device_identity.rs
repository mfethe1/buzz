//! Stable per-install device identity.
//!
//! Buzz agents carry device-local secrets: `apply_inbound_managed_agent` is a
//! deliberate no-op on no-match, so a persona synced to a second computer mints
//! a *fresh* keypair there. One name, N pubkeys, N computers — and nothing in
//! the UI says which computer an agent actually lives on. This module supplies
//! that missing noun.
//!
//! # What this is NOT
//!
//! It is not [`crate::managed_agents::runtime::current_instance_id`]. That
//! returns the Tauri *bundle identifier* — a build constant, identical on every
//! machine — and exists to keep a dev build from reaping a packaged build's
//! processes on the SAME computer. The two answer different questions and must
//! stay separate.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `<app-data>/agents/device.json`, written `0o600` via
//! `atomic_write_json_restricted` — the same pattern the agent store and
//! `global-agent-config.json` use.
//!
//! # Privacy
//!
//! `device_label` is published in a world-readable kind:30177 event (see
//! [`crate::managed_agents::agent_events`]), so it starts **opaque** —
//! `device-<8 hex>`, derived from the id and saying nothing about the machine.
//! Host names routinely contain a real person's name, so the OS host name is
//! only ever *offered* as a suggestion ([`hostname_suggestion`]) and reaches the
//! relay solely when the owner applies it via [`set_device_label`]. Every label,
//! whichever boundary it arrives from — typed, loaded from disk, or received
//! from a peer — passes [`validate_device_label`], the same visible-text policy
//! that guards agent definition text. The opaque `device_id` alone is enough to
//! tell N devices apart.
